it's Sunday night and I have covid (which is apparently still a thing). and I'm trying to find a project to work on so I can learn how to use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) and get with the times. also I'm upset at how terrible dating apps are these days... so

here are some tenets of an actually[^1] successful product/business:

1. the product serves the client (not vice-versa)
2. it's transparent (open source? @markzuckerberg)

dating apps do neither so should be replaced by a tech company that has cooler tech and does these things

why is the model of a dating app that you pay for the right to like people, and to see who likes you? I'm too awkward to do that in real life that's why I signed up for this in the first place. that's morally equivalent to VSCode charging you to write code after you download it for free[^2]

commits will be sparse until I learn how to use Cursor (and OCaml without my company tools)

[^1]: something that doesn't just use natural resource or have a monopoly
[^2]: technically it's like VSCode charging you to write more than 3 lines of code per day... like what?
